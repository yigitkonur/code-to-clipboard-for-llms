Interacting with LLMs like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini or apps like [Thinkbuddy](https://thinkbuddy.ai) üí´ about your codebase often requires providing substantial context. Manually selecting, copying, and formatting relevant files is time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient, especially when dealing with context window limits and token costs.

`code-to-clipboard-for-llms` streamlines this process. It's a Python script that automatically:

1.  **Scans** your project directory.
2.  **Filters** out irrelevant files and noise (like `node_modules`, build artifacts, `.git`).
3.  **Structures** the relevant code logically.
4.  **Formats** everything into clean Markdown, optimized for LLMs.
5.  **Copies** the result directly to your clipboard.

Spend less time preparing context and more time getting valuable insights from your AI assistant.

## The Problem It Solves

Providing effective code context to LLMs manually is challenging:

*   **Token Limits & Cost:** Including irrelevant files wastes the LLM's limited context window and increases API costs.
*   **Noise & Confusion:** Dependency code, logs, or build artifacts can confuse the LLM, leading to less accurate responses.
*   **Lack of Structure:** Randomly pasted files make it difficult for the LLM to understand project architecture and file relationships.
*   **Manual Effort:** Selecting, filtering, formatting, and copying files by hand is tedious and inefficient.

## The Solution: `code-to-clipboard-for-llms`

This tool addresses these challenges by providing:

*   ‚úÖ **Intelligent Filtering:** Automatically excludes common unnecessary directories and files, respects `.gitignore` rules, and leverages Git tracking status (configurable).
*   üß† **Optimized Structure & Ordering:** Presents files logically (README first, then key files sorted by relevance) with clear Markdown formatting and syntax hints. Includes a visual file tree.
*   ‚è±Ô∏è **One-Command Operation:** Simplifies the entire context gathering process into a single command executed in your project directory.
*   üìã **Direct Clipboard Integration:** Sends the formatted context straight to your clipboard, ready to paste.
*   üîß **Customization:** Offers flags to fine-tune filtering, sizing, and output behavior.

## üöÄ Quick Installation (Recommended)

The easiest way to get started is using the provided installers. They handle downloading the script, setting up the necessary PATH environment variable, installing dependencies, and creating a convenient command alias (`context` on macOS/Linux, `copyc` on Windows).

**Choose your operating system and run the corresponding one-line command in your terminal:**

### macOS / Linux (Bash or Zsh)

```bash
# For macOS:
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yigitkonur/code-to-clipboard-for-llms/main/install-mac.sh)"

# For Linux (Debian/Ubuntu based tested):
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yigitkonur/code-to-clipboard-for-llms/main/install-linux.sh)"
```

### Windows (PowerShell 5.1+)

```powershell
# Ensure PowerShell can run scripts (you might need to run as Administrator or adjust policy: Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser)
iex "& {$(irm 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yigitkonur/code-to-clipboard-for-llms/main/install-windows.ps1')}"
```

**‚û°Ô∏è Important:** After installation, **close and reopen your terminal** window or tab. This is necessary for the new command and PATH changes to take effect.

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Basic Usage

Using the tool is designed to be simple:

1.  Install by extremely easy scripts to follow:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yigitkonur/code-to-clipboard-for-llms/
    cd code-to-clipboard-for-llms && chmod +x install-mac.sh && ./install-mac.sh
    ```
2.  Run the command:
    *   macOS/Linux: `context` (some people, incl **me** use `copy`)
    *   Windows: `copyc` (you can change it by editing powershell script)
    ```bash
    context # Or copyc on Windows
    ```
3.  The script will process the project and copy the formatted Markdown context to your clipboard.
4.  Paste the content into your LLM prompt and ask your question.

**Output Options:**

*   **Save to File:** Instead of copying to the clipboard, save the output to a Markdown file:
    ```bash
    context --output project_context.md
    ```
*   **Print to Terminal:** Display the output directly in the terminal (useful for previewing or piping):
    ```bash
    context --stdout
    ```

## üîë Key Features Summary

*   **Automatic Filtering:** Excludes irrelevant files/directories (`node_modules`, `.git`, `build`, `venv`, logs, etc.).
*   **.gitignore Aware:** Uses `.gitignore` rules for exclusion (requires `gitignore-parser`).
*   **Git Tracking Option:** Can optionally exclude files not tracked by Git.
*   **Smart Ordering:** Prioritizes README, sorts files and directories by estimated importance (lines of code).
*   **LLM-Optimized Markdown:** Clean formatting, code blocks with language hints, file paths.
*   **Visual File Tree:** Includes a tree view (`‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ`, `‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ`) with markers (‚úÖ/‚ùå) showing included/excluded items.
*   **Metadata:** Includes file statistics (lines, characters, percentage) for context.
*   **Privacy:** Masks user's home directory path in the output summary.
*   **Configurable:** Command-line flags for including/excluding specific patterns, types, and controlling behavior.
*   **Flexible Output:** Clipboard (default), file (`--output`), or standard output (`--stdout`).
*   **Cross-Platform:** Python 3 script with installers for macOS, Linux, Windows.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Usage & Customization

While the defaults work well, you can tailor the script's behavior using flags:

<details>
<summary><strong>Expand for detailed command-line flag reference</strong></summary>

#### Filtering and Inclusion Control

*   `--include PATTERN`: Glob pattern to force inclusion of specific files or directories that might otherwise be excluded (e.g., `--include "tests/specific_test.py"`, `--include "config/**.yaml"`). Does not override excluded directories like `node_modules`. Can be used multiple times.
*   `--exclude PATTERN`: Glob pattern to add custom exclusions beyond the defaults (e.g., `--exclude "*.log"`, `--exclude "docs/*"`). Can be used multiple times.
*   `--exclude-extension EXT`: Exclude all files with a specific extension (e.g., `--exclude-extension .tmp`).
*   `--include-extension EXT`: Force include files with an extension normally excluded by default (use carefully).

#### Include Specific File Types (Overrides default exclusions)

*   `--include-json`: Include `.json` / `.jsonc` files.
*   `--include-yaml`: Include `.yaml` / `.yml` files.
*   `--include-xml`: Include `.xml` files.
*   `--include-html`: Include `.html` / `.htm` files.
*   `--include-css`: Include `.css` files.
*   `--include-sql`: Include `.sql` files.
*   `--include-csv`: Include `.csv` / `.tsv` files.
*   `--include-markdown`: Include *all* Markdown files (`.md`, `.markdown`, `.rst`), not just the root README.

#### Size and Content Control

*   `--max-size SIZE`: Exclude files larger than the specified size (e.g., `500k`, `10M`, `1G`). Use `0` for no limit. Default is `2M`.
*   `--include-binary`: Attempt to include files detected as binary (default is false).

#### Output Behavior

*   `--no-clipboard`: Disable automatic copying to the clipboard.

#### Git Integration Behavior

*(Requires `gitignore-parser` Python library: `pip install gitignore-parser`)*

*   `--no-gitignore`: Ignore `.gitignore` rules and Git tracking status entirely.
*   `--gitignore-only`: Use `.gitignore` rules but *don't* exclude files solely because they are untracked by Git.

</details>

### Permanent Configuration

For persistent changes, you can modify the default lists directly within the `copy.py` script:

*   `DEFAULT_EXCLUDED_DIRS`: Tuple of directory names always excluded recursively.
*   `DEFAULT_EXCLUDED_PATTERNS`: Tuple of file glob patterns excluded by default.
*   `FILES_TO_ALWAYS_CHECK`: Set of crucial filenames (e.g., `Dockerfile`, `requirements.txt`) considered even if their extension is excluded by default patterns.
*   `SKIP_ALWAYS`: Set of filenames always excluded, overriding other rules.

## üìÑ Understanding the Output Format

The generated Markdown is structured for clarity:

<details>
<summary><strong>Expand for output structure details</strong></summary>

1.  **Header Section:** Title, project directory (masked), legend for tree symbols.
2.  **Tree Section:** Visual tree (`.`, `‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ`, `‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ`, `‚îÇ`) showing included (‚úÖ) and excluded (‚ùå) files/directories, with stats for included files (lines, chars, percentage).
3.  **Summary Statistics:** Total counts for included files, lines, and characters.
4.  **Separator:** (`---`)
5.  **Selected File Content Section:**
    *   For each included file (in priority order):
        *   `### /relative/path/to/file`: File path header.
        *   `*(Stats: ...)*`: Line and character counts for the file.
        *   ```` ```[language_hint] ````: Fenced code block with detected language hint (e.g., `python`, `javascript`).
        *   File content.
        *   ` ``` `: End of code block.
        *   Blank line separator.

## üõ†Ô∏è Manual Installation (Alternative)

If you prefer not to use the installers:

1.  **Prerequisites:** Ensure Python 3 (3.6+ recommended) and pip are installed.
2.  **(Optional but Recommended) Install Dependencies:** For clipboard and `.gitignore` support:
    ```bash
    pip install --user pyperclip gitignore-parser
    # Or pip3, depending on your system setup
    ```
3.  **Download:** Get the `copy.py` script from this repository (e.g., via `curl` or by downloading the repo):
    ```bash
    curl -fLo copy.py https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yigitkonur/code-to-clipboard-for-llms/main/copy.py
    ```
4.  **Move to PATH:** Place `copy.py` in a directory included in your system's PATH. A common choice is `~/bin` on Linux/macOS or a dedicated scripts folder on Windows.
    ```bash
    mkdir -p ~/bin && mv copy.py ~/bin/
    ```
5.  **Make Executable (Linux/macOS):**
    ```bash
    chmod +x ~/bin/copy.py
    ```
6.  **Add to PATH (if needed):** Ensure the directory (e.g., `~/bin`) is in your PATH environment variable. This often involves editing shell configuration files (`~/.zshrc`, `~/.bashrc`, `~/.bash_profile`) or system environment variables (Windows). Example for `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`:
    ```bash
    # Add this line if ~/bin is not in your PATH
    export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"
    ```
7.  **(Optional) Create Alias:** For easier use, add an alias to your shell configuration file:
    ```bash
    # Add this line after the PATH export
    alias context='python3 $HOME/bin/copy.py'
    ```
8.  **Reload Shell:** Apply changes by restarting your terminal or sourcing the config file (e.g., `source ~/.bashrc`).

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

Common issues and potential solutions:

<details>
<summary><strong>Expand for troubleshooting tips</strong></summary>

*   **`context: command not found` / `copyc: command not found`:**
    *   Did you restart your terminal after installation? (Most common fix)
    *   Is the script's directory (`~/bin` or `Scripts`) correctly added to your system's PATH? Verify with `echo $PATH` (Linux/Mac) or `echo $env:Path` (PowerShell).
    *   (Manual Install) Did you correctly set up the alias in your shell config file? Check with `alias context`.
    *   (Manual Install) Did you source your shell config file after editing?

*   **Clipboard Issues / `pyperclip` errors:**
    *   Ensure `pyperclip` is installed: `pip show pyperclip`. If not, `pip install pyperclip`.
    *   **Linux:** `pyperclip` may require system tools like `xclip` or `xsel`. Install via package manager (e.g., `sudo apt install xclip`).
    *   Try the `--stdout` or `--output` flags to bypass clipboard issues temporarily.

*   **`.gitignore` Not Working:**
    *   Ensure `gitignore-parser` is installed: `pip show gitignore-parser`. If not, `pip install gitignore-parser`.
    *   Ensure you haven't used the `--no-gitignore` flag.

*   **Script Errors:**
    *   Verify Python 3 version (`python3 --version`) is 3.6 or higher.
    *   Check file permissions if the script fails reading specific files.
    *   If you edited the script, check for syntax errors. Try a fresh copy.

*   **Incorrect Files Included/Excluded:**
    *   Review the visual tree output (‚úÖ/‚ùå) to understand the script's decisions.
    *   Use `--stdout` to preview before relying on clipboard.
    *   Adjust filtering with `--include` / `--exclude` flags.
    *   Check your `.gitignore` file for relevant patterns.
